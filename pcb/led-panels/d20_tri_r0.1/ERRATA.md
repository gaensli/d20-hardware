# Errata

    This design has known serious errata, avoid fabrication of this revision

## 1. 2020 RGB LED footprint wrong

### Severity
> Serious

### Descrition
> This is a pin numbering issue. Which requires mounting the LEDs at 90deg. Because the pads are not rotationally symmetrical this is very difficult to achieve without LEDs rotating during reflow.



## 2. Mosfet footprints wrong

### Severity
> Serious

### Descrition
> Gate and Drain pins are swapped on the layout for the MOSFET. To fix this requires tedious rework.
